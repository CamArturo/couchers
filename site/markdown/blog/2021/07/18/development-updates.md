We publish regular development updates to let you know what we have been working on, as well as what's coming soon.

## Roadmap

A quick overview of what the development team will be working on in the next few weeks.

### Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We've started our mobile development team, but are still looking for contributors to join and help on development of the app, if you're interested, please fill in the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute).

We aim to get Beta quality apps out by the end of this year.

### Events and community features

We have started releasing parts of the events feature. For now, events are created by admins manually, but we will add functionality for creating and editing events on the platform in the next releases. If you'd like to create an event, please get in touch!

We have started looking for Community Builders: couch surfers who want to grow their local community on the Couchers.org platform. They are responsible for creating content for their community, and bringing new users, and will form the backbone of the community growth plan. If you'd like to help build your local community, please fill in the [Community Builder form](https://couchers.org/community-builder-form).

## Latest features and bugfixes

Here's a summary of a few of the bigger features and bugs we worked on over the past two weeks:

* Events
* Signup flow
* Reference remidner emails



## Stats

TODO

Since the last update two weeks ago, we had 11 developers contribute to Couchers.org in 301 changes that changed 4.8 thousand lines of code. We welcome the three new contributors who joined in the project and helped out on the codebase.

None of this would be possible without our 100+ volunteers working in all areas of the project. The development teams would like to thank the rest of the core contributors for making our work possible.

## Join the development team

If you're a developer, please join our team on GitHub at [Couchers-org/couchers](https://github.com/couchers-org/couchers) or just give us a star if you appreciate our work! All our code is open source and we need all the help we can get in building the new Couchsurfingâ„¢ alternative.
