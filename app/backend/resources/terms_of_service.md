You must agree to these Terms to access the Couchers.org services and create an account.

**Note: we'll update the Terms of Service as we approach the full launch and clarify the reasons and ways in which we may terminate or ban accounts as we develop these processes and solidify our moderation process.**

*This is version 2.0 of the Terms of Service, last updated on 5th May, 2021.*

# 1. Foundation

Access to the Couchers.org platform ("platform", "service") is provided to you by the **Couchers.org Foundation** ("Couchers.org", "we", "us"), a non-profit organization formed in Sydney, Australia.


# 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old to access the service.


# 3. Account information

You are responsible for any activity done using your account, as well as securing your account from inappropriate access. For example, you must use a secure password not shared across other products or services, and you cannot leave your account logged in on shared computers. If you give access to your account to others for any purpose, you are liable for any such activity.

You must provide truthful and current information on your account. Your display name does not need to be your legal name and your display location does not need to be your true location. You may hide or obfuscate information on your public profile for your own privacy or security, but you may not do so in a way that would reasonably deceive other users. Information used in verification must be truthful and accurate, this includes your birth date, your gender identity, your legal name, and your verification address.


# 4. Liability and your interactions with others

Couchers.org provides a platform for users to contact one another and organise activities together. You agree to not hold us liable or responsible for user-created content or for interactions between users, including online and in person. You are solely liable and responsible for your actions on the platform, including any interactions with other users and any content that you create.

Although we are not legally responsible for user-created content, we actively moderate the platform to remove any content that is harmful, deceitful, or otherwise does not adhere to our rules. If you believe some content does not adhere to our rules, please report it to us via support@couchers.org.

We are not liable if at any time, with or without prior notice, we modify, suspend or discontinue our services.


# 5. Our service providers

We take utmost care to protect your personal data and choose our service providers carefully.

Our platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and we use a variety of their products to provide this service to you, including hosting our servers, storing our backups, and sending transactional emails.

We manage our mailing lists for our newsletter and general announcements using MailChimp. You agree to be added to our mailing list. You may unsubscribe at any time from within these emails. We only share minimal information with MailChimp required to send you these emails, such as your email address and display name.


# 6. Termination

If you are in breach of these terms or any other policies in place, we may at our discretion suspend or terminate your account.
