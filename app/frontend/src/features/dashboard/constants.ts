## Community features

We've started releasing features within our local communities theme and will continue to do so in the next couple of releases. The next big community feature will be events, then guides and pages. We created a few initial communities and will work with local community leaders in the next few weeks to establishing more communities on the platform.

If you are interested in becoming a community leader, it's not too late to reach out to us by filling in the [contributor form](https://app.couchers.org/contribute). If you are already heavily involved in a local travel community, please also reach out.

## Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We've started up our mobile development team but are still looking for more experienced mobile devs with experience in React Native or Flutter to join the team. If you have the skills to help, please fill in the contributor form below and we'll be in touch.

This process will take some time, but you can expect to hear more about these apps later this year.

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

# Bugs

Bugs are to be expected, as we are still in a phase of rapid development. We appreciate you being here to help with that. If you notice any bugs, please report them with the red button in the top right corner.

Please discuss anything else about the app on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/).`;
