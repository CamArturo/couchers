## Community features

We will start releasing features that are part of our local communities theme in the next few days, including discussions and a basic community page. We continue working on these features and will be releasing events, guides, and pages soon.

In the coming weeks we will also work with local community leaders and start establishing the initial communities on the platform.

If you are interested in becoming a community leader, it's not too late to reach out to us by filling in the contributor form below. If you are already heavily involved in a local travel community, please also reach out.

## Invite feature and new signup flow

We will be redesigning the signup flow and creating an invite system to allow you to invite your friends and see how many people joined from your invitations.

## Mobile applications for iOS and Android

We're ramping up our effort to develop native mobile apps. We're currently looking for people experienced in the relevant technologies (React Native, Flutter, Swift/Kotlin, etc) to help us make solid architectural decisions before we move our development focus to mobile apps. If you have the skills to help, please fill in the contributor form below and we'll be in touch.

This process will take some time, but you can expect to hear more about these apps later this year.

*The Beta is still being worked on at a rapid rate, and things will continue to change quickly for the foreseeable future, so check back often for updates.*

# Bugs

Bugs are to be expected, as we are still in a phase of rapid development. We appreciate you being here to help with that. If you notice any bugs, please report them with the red button in the top right corner.

Please discuss anything else about the app on the [Community Forum](https://community.couchers.org/).`;
