          <h1>Welcome to the Couchers.org Alpha!</h1>
          <p><b>This site is in Alpha stage, it is not complete and we will completely redesign the site in the coming weeks as we launch a Beta release.</b></p>
          <h2>Bugs</h2>
          <p>Bugs are to be expected. If you notice any bugs (except for visual and layout bugs specific to the Alpha design), please report them with the red button in the top right corner.</p>
          <p>Please discuss anything else about the Alpha on the <a href="https://community.couchers.org">Community Forum</a>.</p>
          <h2>User data</h2>
          <p>From now on, your <b>basic profile and login information</b> will be stored and migrated to the Beta and from there onto v1.</p>
          <p>All other site data &mdash; such as messages, references, and requests &mdash; are subject to deletion. This may happen if we make major changes in the database structure and migrating user data is too time consuming.</p>
          <p>Once we release the Beta, this policy will change, and we will guarantee more data is ported onto v1. Check back once the Beta launches!</p>
          <h2>Alpha limitations</h2>
          <p>The Alpha works best on a computer, but not quite yet on a small phone screen! We are working on better phone support for Beta.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind that this is just an alpha version. We know it's buggy, and we know it's a bit ugly and clunky. Please help out by poking around and reporting anything that's not working. We hope you'll be the one using it, so use this opportunity to give feedback and share what would work best for you.</p>
          <h2>Uptime</h2>
          <p>During the Alpha and Beta testing phases, we will take the site down occasionally to perform upgrades. Once we near v1, we will work on reducing downtime during upgrades.</p>
